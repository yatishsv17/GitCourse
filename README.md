Git : Distributed version control system

### Workflow Stages

| Workflow Stages | Details |
|-----------------|--------|
| Local Computer    | : ```git init [project name]``` creates a new local repository in the current directory<br>: ```git clone <project url>``` Downloads a project with the entire history from the remote                                                                                                                                  |
| Working Directory | : After ```git clone```<br>: ```git diff``` show changes between working directory and staging area<br>: ```git diff sourceBranch TargetBranch``` shows difference between two branches<br>: ```git pull``` , Pulls the latest commits from remote to local directory<br>: ```git branch``` List all local branches in repository, ```git branch -a``` List all branches including remote repository<br>: ```git branch [branch_name]``` Create new branch, referencing to HEAD<br>: ```git checkout [-b] [branch_name]``` : Switch working directory to the specified branch. With -b: Git will create the specified branch if it does not exist.<br>: ```git merge [branch_name]``` , Join specified [branch_name] branch into your current branch (the one you are on currently).<br>: ```git branch -d [branch_name]``` , Remove selected branch, if it is already merged into any other. -D instead of -d forces deletion.<br>: ```git rebase [branch_name]``` , Apply commits of the current working branch and apply them to the HEAD of [branch] to make the history of your branch more linear so that you have most recent updated version of branch before commiting your changes<br>: ```git clean``` removes untracked (unstaged) files |
| Staging Area      | : After ```git add [file]```<br>: Marking only selected files to be commited<br>: ```git status``` show which files are marked to be commited, reflecting the status of your working directory for each branch :-<br>1. New files<br>2. Modified files<br>3. Unstaged or Staged(Pending to Commit) Files<br>: ```git diff --staged [file]``` shows any changes between the staging area and the repository<br>: ```git rm [file]``` , Remove file from working directory and staging area                                                                                                                                    |
| Local Repository  | : After ```git commit```, Save changes to project, its like Snapshot with Hash Key and is never lost<br>: ```git log``` shows all the commit info in that particular branch<br>: ```git show [hash]``` shows all the changes happened to all the changed files in particular commit<br>: ```git reflog``` shows all the changes happened on all commits on all branches<br>: ```git revert [commit hash]``` Create a new commit, reverting changes from the specified commit. It generates an inversion of changes.<br>: ```git reset [commit Hash]``` Resets the current branch to show only commits upto the commit you indicate disregarding all subsequent commits<br>: ```git reset --soft [commit Hash]``` Resets the current branch to show only commits upto the commit you indicate disregarding all subsequent commits but keeps the changes they have introduced<br>: ```git reset --hard [commit Hash]``` Resets the current branch to show only commits upto the commit you indicate disregarding all subsequent commits including changes                                                                                                                                 |
| Remote Repository | : Afer ```git push``` , Ths sends all the local changes to GitHub repository                                                                                                                              |
